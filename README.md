# Virt-scripts

This suite of "quick and dirty" scripts are intended to mount virtual sandboxes for labs during Linux training courses with KVM/libvirtd (on Centos 7/8, Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 or Debian stable hosts).
The main goal is to spawn quickly linux guests for lab purposes. But we can find other subsequents objectives as coding/scripting, automation or virtual networks and system management, helping to understand virtual infrastructures technologies and architectures. Only for educational purposes.

Three groups of scripts :

1. Native installation for Centos 7/8 Debian Stable and Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 and post-installation.
2. Quickbuilder, guests spwaning with pre-builded images
3. Devices management

If you already have images at stock, there exists better ways to automate and manage libvirt guest like those nice scripts :

* in python :  `kcli` (https://github.com/karmab/kcli)
* in bash : https://github.com/vpenso/libvirt-shell-functions

For native installation of Arch Linux : look at https://github.com/Anthony25/spawn-archlinux-libvirt.

## Native installation and post-installation

Purposes : gold image auto-creation

1. `autoprep.sh` : prepare your system as virtualization host
2. `download-images.sh` : get a builded image by this project
3. `auto-install.sh` : build by yourself a fresh Centos, Debian or Ubuntu system with http repos and kickstart files
4. `auto-install-tui.sh` : auto-install.sh text user interface demo
5. `sparsify.sh` : optimize space disk on the designated guest
6. `clone.sh` : clone as linked, sysprep and optimize builded guests
7. `hosts-file` : display the running guests and their ipv4 address as /etc/hosts file
8. `nested-physical.sh` : nested virtualization installation on the physical host

## Build your images with Packer, Qemu/KVM and Ansible

You can also build your images with Packer and Ansible automation based ont this other educational project [https://github.com/goffinet/packer-kvm](https://github.com/goffinet/packer-kvm)

Some images are available for download on https://download.goffinet.org/kvm : centos7 centos8 fedora32 debian10 bionic focal.

You can download them with the `download-images.sh` script :

```
./download-images.sh
-------------------------------------------------------
This script download automatically KVM images
from https://download.goffinet.org/kvm.

Usage:
  ./download-images.sh image_name [--force]

Where the "image_name" parameter can be:
bionic focal centos7 centos8 debian10 fedora32
The option "--force" does not ask for any confirmation.

Examples:
  ./download-images.sh bionic --force
  ./download-images.sh focal
-------------------------------------------------------
```

As it with user interaction :

```
./download-images.sh centos7
The image /var/lib/libvirt/images/centos7.qcow2 does not exist.

```

You can force the download for automation purpose :

```
./download-images.sh debian10 --force
The image /var/lib/libvirt/images/debian10.qcow2 already exists.
The local image is exactly the same than the remote

```

## Quickbuilder

Purposes : deploy quickly guests based on pre-builded with previous scripts.

1. `define-guest-image.sh` : deploy pre-builded images (like a quickbuilder, provisionner) as linked clones
2. `deploy-image-by-profile.sh` : deploy pre-builded images by profiles (xs, s, m, l xl)  as linked clones
3. `get-and-install-openwrt.sh` : get and start openwrt with two interfaces

But this is probably better to build by yourself your appliance with the `auto-install.sh` script or with packer and qemu. The root account and the password are stored in the "preseed" and "kickstart" templates included in the script.

## Devices management

Purposes : change RAM and vcpus, add block devices and network facilities

To assign public IPs on VMs hosted on Hetzner hosts see [Connect public IPv4 addresses, IPv4 and IPv6 subnets on Hetzner servers](README.hetzner.md).

- `add-memory.sh` : add RAM
- `add-vcpu.sh` : set vcpus count
- `add-bridge.sh` : add an isolated or ipv4 nat/ipv6 ula local libvirt bridge
- `add-bridge-l2.sh` : create a L2 bridge that connects a physical NIC
- `add-bridge-l3.sh` : create a L3 bridge to forward (Hetzner) IPv4 public ranges to your guests
- `add-nic.sh` : a new NIC on live guest to a bridged interface
- `attach-nic.sh` : attach a live guest present NIC to a bridge
- `detach-nic.sh` : detach a live guest from a bridge
- `add-storage.sh` : attach an empty bit disk by GB size
- `start_all.sh` : start all the defined guests
- `destroy-and-undefine-all.sh` : destroy,  undefine all the guests with storage removing

## How-To

First clone this project in your home directory :

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/goffinet/virt-scripts
cd virt-scripts
```

### Step 1 : Verify your installation

Script : `autoprep.sh`

Description : Setup KVM/Libvirtd/LibguestFS on RHEL7/Centos 7/Debian Jessie.

Usage :

```
# ./autoprep.sh
This script will install all the necessary packages to use Libvirtd/KVM
Please reboot your host after this step
Are you sure? [y/N]
```

### Step 2 : Build a guest automatically

Script : `auto-install.sh`

Description :  Centos 7, Debian Stretch or Ubuntu Bionic fully automatic installation by HTTP Repo and response file (preseed or kickstart) via local HTTP server.

Usage :

Please check all the parameters. For customization, you can adapt the kickstart or preseed templates inside the script.

```
# ./auto-install.sh

Usage : ./auto-install.sh [ centos | debian | ubuntu ] nom_de_vm
Please provide one distribution centos, debian, ubuntu and one guest name: exit
```

Note : Escape character is :

* `^]` (CTRL+ `]`) on Unix french keyboards
* CTRL + 5 on Windows french keyboards


### Step 3 : Sparse your native image

Script : `sparsify.sh`

Description : Sparse a disk. Great gain on disk space !

Usage :

```
./sparsify.sh
This script sparses an attached disk
Please provide a the guest name of a destroyed guest: exit
Usage : ./sparsify.sh <guest name>
```

Check the disk usage : 2,0G

```
# du -h /var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu-gold-31122016.qcow2
2,0G    /var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu-gold-31122016.qcow2
```

Sparsify operation

```
# ./sparsify.sh ubuntu-gold-31122016

```

Check the disk usage : 432M


```
# du -h /var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu-gold-31122016.qcow2
432M    /var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu-gold-31122016.qcow2
```

### Step 4 : Clone your guest

Script : clone.sh

Description : Cloning a domain disk with sparsifying and Linux sysprep.

Usage :

```
./clone.sh
This script clones, sparsifies and syspreps linux guest
Usage : './clone.sh <original guest> <destination guest>'
Please provide a the guest name of a destroyed guest: exit
```

### Step 5 : Quickbuilder

Assume that you have installed two guests with `auto-install.sh` :

```
~/virt-scripts# ./auto-install.sh centos7 centos
~/virt-scripts# ./auto-install.sh ubuntu1804 ubuntu
```

And you can verify it :

```
~/virt-scripts# virsh list --all
 Id    Name                           State
----------------------------------------------------
 -     centos7                      shut off
 -     ubuntu1804                     shut off

```

Undefine original guests :

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd ~/virt-scripts
for x in centos7 ubuntu1804
do
virsh undefine $x
done

```

And you can deploy quickly builded and optimized guests based on those images :

```
~/virt-scripts# ./define-guest-image.sh c1 centos7

Début d'installation...
Création du domaine...                                                   |    0 B     00:00
Création du domaine terminée.  Vous pouvez redémarrer votre domaine en lançant :
  virsh --connect qemu:///system start c1
```

```
~/virt-scripts# ./define-guest-image.sh u1 ubuntu1804

Début d'installation...
Création du domaine...                                                   |    0 B     00:00
Création du domaine terminée.  Vous pouvez redémarrer votre domaine en lançant :
  virsh --connect qemu:///system start u1
```

Also, I have prebuilded other images for training classes :

```
~/virt-scripts# ./define-guest-image.sh
Usage : ./define-guest-image.sh <name> <image>
Please download one of those images :
https://download.goffinet.org/kvm/centos7.qcow2
https://download.goffinet.org/kvm/ubuntu1804.qcow2
```

You can download them with `download-images.sh` :

```
./download-images.sh centos7
The image /var/lib/libvirt/images/centos7.qcow2 does not exist.
Do you want anyway download this file centos7.qcow2
Are you sure? [y/N] y
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  611M  100  611M    0     0   123M      0  0:00:04  0:00:04 --:--:--  123M
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100    56  100    56    0     0   2153      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  2153
centos7.qcow2: OK
```

### Step 6 : Manage guests as usual with Libvirt

Verify your running guests :

```
~/virt-scripts# virsh list
 Id    Name                           State
----------------------------------------------------
 88    c1                             running
 89    u1                             running
```

Access to the text console :

```
~/virt-scripts# virsh console c1
Connected to domain c1
Escape character is ^]

CentOS Linux 7 (Core)
Kernel 3.10.0-514.6.2.el7.x86_64 on an x86_64

centos7 login:
```

To exit from the text console execute CTRL `]`.

### Step 7 : Add the guest hostname resolution

Script : `hosts-file.sh`

Description : Print a new `/etc/resolv.conf` with the ip address and the hostname of running guests.

Usage :

```
./hosts-file.sh
```

For example :

```
./hosts-file.sh
192.168.122.47 c1
192.168.122.118 u1
```

To update your `/etc/hosts` :

```
./hosts-file.sh >> /etc/hosts
```

SSH is enabled by default :

```
~/virt-scripts# ssh c1
The authenticity of host 'c1 (192.168.122.47)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 04:be:d2:e9:d9:9a:98:02:e3:a8:34:2d:3a:dd:26:a5.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'c1,192.168.122.47' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
root@c1's password:
[root@centos7 ~]# exit
déconnexion
Connection to c1 closed.
```

### Step 8 : Manage devices

Script : `add-bridge.sh`

Description : add an isolated or ipv4 nat/ipv6 ula libvirt bridge

Usage :

```
./add-bridge.sh
Description : This script create an isolated or a nat/ipv6 bridge
Usage       : ./add-bridge.sh <name> <interface> <type, isolated or nat>
Example     : './add-bridge.sh net1 virbr100 isolated' or './add-bridge.sh lan101 virbr101 nat'
```

Associated scripts :

* `add-nic.sh` : a new NIC on live guest to a bridged interface
* `attach-nic.sh` : attach a live guest present NIC to a bridge
* `detach-nic.sh` : detach a live guest from a bridge


Script : `add-storage.sh`

Description : attach an empty bit disk by GB size

Usage :

```
./add-storage.sh
Description : This script attach a disk to a live guest
Usage       : ./add-storage.sh <guest name> <block device name> <size in GB>
Example     : './add-storage.sh guest1 vdb 4' add a vdb 4GB disk to guest1
```

To be continued ... with :

* `add-memory.sh` : add RAM
* `add-vcpu.sh` : set vcpus count
* `start_all.sh` : start all the defined guests
* `destroy-and-undefine-all.sh` : destroy,  undefine all the guests with storage removing

### Connect public IPv4 addresses, IPv4 and IPv6 subnets on Hetzner servers
